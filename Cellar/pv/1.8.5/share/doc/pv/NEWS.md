### 1.8.5 - 19 November 2023

 * fix: corrected percentage formatting so it doesn't jump from 2 to 3 characters wide at 100% ([#80](https://codeberg.org/a-j-wood/pv/issues/80))
 * fix: replaced "`--remote`" mechanism, using a temporary file instead of SysV IPC, so it can work reliably even when there are multiple PV instances
 * fix: corrected compilation failure when without IPC support
 * security: addressed all issues highlighted by the software auditing tools "`splint`" and "`flawfinder`" (see "`make analyse`") ([#77](https://codeberg.org/a-j-wood/pv/issues/77))
 * cleanup: compilation warnings fixed on non-IPC and MacOS systems

### 1.8.0 - 24 September 2023

#### Features

 * feature: new "`--discard`" option to discard input as if writing to */dev/null* ([#42](https://codeberg.org/a-j-wood/pv/issues/42))
 * feature: new "`--error-skip-block`" option to make "`--skip-errors`" skip whole blocks ([#37](https://codeberg.org/a-j-wood/pv/issues/37))
 * feature: use `posix_fadvise()` like `cat`(1) does, to improve efficiency ([#39](https://codeberg.org/a-j-wood/pv/issues/39))
 * feature: new "`--enable-static`" option to "`configure`" for static builds ([#75](https://codeberg.org/a-j-wood/pv/pull/75))

#### Security

 * security: with "`--pidfile`", write to a temporary file and rename it into place, to improve security
 * security: keep self-contained copies of name and format string in PV internal state for memory safety
 * security: ignore _TMP_ / _TMPDIR_ environment variables when using a terminal lock file

#### Fixes

 * fix: only report errors about missing files when starting to transfer from them, not while calculating size, and behave more like `cat`(1) by skipping them and moving on
 * fix: auto-calculate total line count with "`--line-mode`" when all inputs are regular files
 * fix: use `clock_gettime()` in ETA calculation to cope with machine suspend/resume ([#13](https://codeberg.org/a-j-wood/pv/issues/13))
 * fix: if "`--width`" or "`--height`" were provided, do not change them when the window size changes ([#36](https://codeberg.org/a-j-wood/pv/issues/36))
 * fix: when a file descriptor position in "`--watchfd`" moves backwards, show the rate using the correct prefix ([#41](https://codeberg.org/a-j-wood/pv/issues/41))
 * fix: rewrite terminal state save/restore so state is not intermittently garbled on exit when using "`--cursor`" ([#20](https://codeberg.org/a-j-wood/pv/issues/20)), ([#24](https://codeberg.org/a-j-wood/pv/issues/24))

#### Cleanups

 * cleanup: addressed many potential issues highlighted by the software auditing tools "`splint`" and "`flawfinder`" (see new target "`make analyse`")
 * cleanup: switched the build system to GNU Automake
 * cleanup: replaced the test harness with the one native to GNU Automake
 * cleanup: added a test for terminal width detection to "`make check`"
 * cleanup: added a test to "`make check`" to ensure that "`make install`" installs everything expected
 * cleanup: replaced *AC_HEADER_TIOCGWINSZ* with *AC_CHECK_HEADERS(sys/ioctl.h)* for better MacOS compatibility ([#74](https://codeberg.org/a-j-wood/pv/issues/74))
 * cleanup: with "`--sync`", call `fsync()` instead of `fdatasync()` on incapable systems ([#73](https://codeberg.org/a-j-wood/pv/issues/73))
 * cleanup: the manual is now a static file instead of needing to be built with "`configure`"

#### Dropped items

 * dropped: dropped support for "`--enable-static-nls`"
 * dropped: removed the Linux Software Map file, as the LSM project appears to be long dead
 * dropped: will no longer publish to SourceForge as it has a chequered history and is unnecessary
