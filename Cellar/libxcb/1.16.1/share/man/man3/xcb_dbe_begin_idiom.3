.SH DESCRIPTION
Creates a block of operations intended to occur together. This may be needed if window presentation requires changing buffers unknown to this extension, such as depth or stencil buffers.

If you want to handle errors directly with \fIxcb_request_check\fP instead, use \fIxcb_dbe_begin_idiom_checked\fP. See \fBxcb-requests(3)\fP for details.
